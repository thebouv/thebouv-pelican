Title: about

I'm a teacher at heart and that means after 20ish years of doing a variety of IT work, it's damn time I start putting thoughts down in a blog. I intend to write about my various career insights, my experiments with my homelab, how-to articles here and there if I solve something I can't find a solution for, and more.
